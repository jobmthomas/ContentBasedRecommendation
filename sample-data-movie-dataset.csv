Joker,"Joker is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver. The film, based on DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. An origin story set in 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, and Marc Maron appear in supporting roles. Joker was produced by DC Films, Village Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative, and Joint Effort, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.

Phillips conceived Joker in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese, who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) was the basis for the premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast had signed on by August. Principal photography lasted from September to December 2018 and took place in New York City, Jersey City, and Newark. Joker was the first live-action Batman film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, due to its violent and disturbing content.

Joker premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019—where it won the Golden Lion, the festival's highest prize—and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while Phoenix's performance was praised, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence was met with a divided response.[5] Joker also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence, with the movie theater where the 2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting occurred during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises refusing to show the film.  In 1981, Arthur Fleck works as a clown-for-hire and lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham City. The city is collapsing under unemployment, crime, and financial ruin, leaving segments of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to laugh at inopportune times, and regularly visits a social services worker to obtain medication. After a group of street kids beat him in an alley, Arthur's co-worker, Randall, loans him a gun for protection. Arthur also meets Sophie, a single mother who lives in a neighboring apartment, and invites her to his stand-up comedy routine.

While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Arthur is fired for this infraction; Randall lies and says that Arthur bought the gun himself. During the subway ride home, Arthur is beaten by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the remaining man. The murders unintentionally start a protest movement against Gotham's rich, with protesters donning clown masks in the unidentified killer's image. Arthur later learns that funding cuts are shutting down the social service program, leaving him without access to his medication.

Sophie attends Arthur's stand-up comedy routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. A popular talk show host, Murray Franklin, mocks Arthur by showing clips from the routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to local billionaire and mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Shortly after a visit from two GCPD detectives investigating Arthur's potential involvement in the train murders, Penny falls ill and is hospitalized. Arthur goes to Wayne Manor for answers, where he meets Thomas's son, Bruce. After a scuffle with the family's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, Arthur flees.

At a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is mentally unstable and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny's case file. He discovers that he was adopted after being abandoned as a baby and that Penny was a neglectful mother who allowed her boyfriend to physically abuse him as a child, causing serious head trauma. Distraught, Arthur goes to the hospital and kills his mother. He returns home and enters Sophie's apartment. Frightened, she tells him to leave; it is revealed that their previous encounters were Arthur's delusions.

Arthur is invited to make a guest appearance on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his routine clips. As he puts on his makeup and outfit, he is visited by his former co-workers Gary and Randall. Arthur murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed for treating Arthur well in the past. En route to the studio, he is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with clown protesters; one of the detectives accidentally kills a protester and incites a riot while Arthur escapes in the chaos.

Before the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as ""Joker"", a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur comes out to a warm reception, but begins telling morbid jokes, admits that he killed the men on the train and rants about how society abandoned and mocked him. Arthur then kills Murray before being arrested. Riots break out across Gotham. One of the rioters corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife Martha. A group of rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him; he is hailed as a hero by the crowd and dances to their cheers.

Arthur is imprisoned at Arkham State Hospital. Laughing to himself, his psychiatrist asks him to tell her the joke; he replies that she would not understand. He then runs down the hall being chased by the orderlies, leaving a trail of bloodied footprints."
Toy Story,"Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The feature film directorial debut of John Lasseter, it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.

Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and an astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner Andy Davis, to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated.

Following the success of Pixar's 1988 short film Tin Toy, the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film, told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be ""edgier"". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: ""toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions"". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.

Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,[4] eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide box office. It was critically acclaimed by critics and audiences, who praised the technical innovation of the 3D animation, the wit and thematic sophistication of the screenplay, the musical score, and the voice performances of Hanks and Allen; it is considered by many to be one of the best animated films ever made.[5] The film received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Song for ""You've Got a Friend in Me"", and Best Original Score, as well as winning a Special Achievement Academy Award.[6] In 2005, its first year of eligibility, it was inducted into the National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[7]

In addition to home media and theatrical re-releases, Toy Story-inspired material includes: toys, video games, theme park attractions, spin-offs, merchandise, and three sequels — Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010) and Toy Story 4 (2019) — all of which also garnered massive commercial success and critical acclaim. A spin off TV series called Buzz Lightyear of Star Command aired from 2000 to 2001, starting with a direct to video film, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins.[8][9]     In a world where toys are living things but pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys owned by a boy named Andy Davis are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as his family (including his mom and infant sister Molly) are preparing to move the following week. Andy's toys – including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the piggy bank and Slinky Dog – fear that they will be replaced by new toys from the birthday. Sheriff Woody – the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy – sends out army men led by Sergeant to spy on the party and report the gift results to the others through Playskool baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them being replaced by new toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who thinks that he is a real space ranger.

Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz Lightyear. As Andy prepares for a family outing at a restaurant called Pizza Planet, his mom allows him to bring one toy. Fearing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of a window. This accident misleads the other toys, except Bo Peep and Slinky to accuse Woody of ""murdering"" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they could exact revenge, Andy takes Woody and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. They have a fight, but fall out of the van in the process and the family leaves without them, stranding them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by hitching a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck. Buzz, still thinking that he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game where they are taken by Andy's toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. Inside his room, the two watch in horror as Sid successfully decapitates his younger sister Hannah's Janie doll and replaces it with that of a pterodactyl's, but they are soon fixed by mutant creature toys who Woody and Buzz believe to be cannibals.

After avoiding Sid's dog, Scud, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure, and becomes very sad when he finally realizes that he is a toy after failing to fly out a window, breaking his arm in the process. Woody finds Buzz at Hannah's tea party and takes him back to Sid's room and calls Andy's toys for help but he accidentally shows them Buzz's broken arm and they walk away, leaving him and Buzz stuck. Then the mutant toys turn out to be friendly and fix Buzz's arm. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells a depressed Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next morning, Woody and the mutant toys rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket by ordering Sid to no longer destroy toys, much to his horror. He runs into the house and when he tells Hannah that the toys are alive, she teases him with her Sally doll and chases him upstairs. Woody says goodbye to the mutant toys as he and Buzz escape just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.

The duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz ends up being left behind while saving Woody from Scud and Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car RC. Thinking that Woody is ""killing"" RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody as they continue to chase the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, leaving them behind. Realizing that Sid's rocket is still strapped to Buzz's back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck. Woody manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Before the rocket explodes, Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket and glides with Woody to safety inside a box in Andy's mom's van right next to Andy, who thinks they were in the car all along.

On Christmas Day at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission in order to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is Mrs. Potato Head, to Mr. Potato Head's joy. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, resulting in the two sharing a worried smile."
Jumanji,"Jumanji is a 1995 American fantasy adventure film directed by Joe Johnston. It is an adaptation of the 1981 children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg and the first installment of the Jumanji franchise. The film was written by Van Allsburg, Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh, and Jim Strain and stars Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bonnie Hunt, Bradley Pierce, Jonathan Hyde, and Bebe Neuwirth.

The story centers on a supernatural board game that releases jungle-based hazards upon its players with every turn they take. As a boy in 1969, Alan Parrish became trapped inside the game itself while playing with his best friend Sarah Whittle. Twenty-six years later, in 1995, siblings Judy and Peter Shepherd find the game, begin playing and then unwittingly release the now-adult Alan. After tracking down Sarah, the quartet resolve to finish the game in order to reverse all of the destruction it has caused.

The film was released on December 15, 1995, to mixed reviews, but was a box office success; grossing $263 million worldwide on a budget of approximately $65 million and it became the 10th highest-grossing film of 1995.

An animated television series was exhibited between 1996 to 1999. The film was followed by a parallel sequel, Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), and two direct sequels, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019).  In 1869, near Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys bury a chest. A century later in 1969, Alan Parrish escapes a group of bullies and retreats to a shoe company owned by his father, Sam. He finds Carl Bentley, an employee and friend of his, who reveals a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a machine, but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After being attacked by the bullies, who also steal his bicycle, Alan follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. He finds the chest containing a board game called Jumanji and brings it home.

At home, after an argument with Sam about attending a boarding school, Alan plans to run away. Sarah Whittle, his friend, arrives to return his bicycle, and Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board. Sarah reads the first message on the board and hears an eerie sound. Alan then unintentionally rolls the dice after being startled by the chiming clock; a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a five or eight, and he is sucked into the game. Afterward, a swarm of bats appear and chase Sarah out of the mansion.

Twenty-six years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora, after their parents died in an accident on a ski trip in Canada last winter. Two days later, Judy and Peter find Jumanji in the attic and begin playing it. Their rolls summon big mosquitoes and a swarm of monkeys. The game rules state that everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter's next roll releases a lion and an adult Alan. As Alan makes his way out, he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy, and Peter go to the now abandoned shoe factory where a homeless man tells Alan that Sam abandoned the business to search for Alan after his disappearance, until his death in 1991 along with his wife. Eventually the factory closed, which caused Brantford's economic decline.

Realizing that they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate Sarah, now suffering mental trauma from both Jumanji and Alan's disappearance, and persuade her to join them. Sarah's first move releases fast-growing carnivorous vines, and Alan's next move releases a big-game hunter named Van Pelt, whom Alan first met in the jungle. The next roll summons a herd of various animals, causing a stampede, and a pelican steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl. Back in town, Sarah, Judy and Peter go to the bank to try and bail Alan out. Meanwhile, the stampede wreaks havoc, and Van Pelt steals the game. Peter, Sarah, and Judy track Van Pelt to a department store, where they set booby traps to subdue him and retrieve the game, while Alan, who after revealing his identity to Carl, is set free. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. They release one calamity after another, until Van Pelt arrives. When Alan drops the dice, he wins the game, which causes everything that happened as a result of the game to be reversed.

Alan and Sarah return to 1969 as children, but have memories of the future events. Alan reconciles with his father and admits that he was responsible for the shoe that damaged the factory's machine. Carl is rehired, and Sam tells his son that he does not have to attend boarding school and finally accepts Alan as who he is. Alan and Sarah throw Jumanji into a river, then Sarah gives Alan a kiss saying she would do it before she ""feels too much like a kid"".

Twenty-six years later, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan's parents are still alive and successfully running the family business. He and Sarah meet Judy, Peter, and their parents Jim and Martha for the first time during a Christmas party. Alan offers Jim a job and convinces them to cancel their upcoming ski trip, averting their deaths. The film ends somewhere else in the world, where two young foreign girls hear drumbeats while walking on a beach. Jumanji is seen laying partially buried in the sand."

The film stars Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, and Sophia Loren, with Burgess Meredith, Daryl Hannah, Kevin Pollak, Katie Sagona, Ann Morgan Guilbert. Grumpier Old Men was directed by Howard Deutch, with the screenplay written by Mark Steven Johnson and the original music score composed by Alan Silvestri.

The film was Meredith's final motion picture appearance. He was already suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and had to be gently coached through his role in the film. He died of the disease two years later in 1997. The feud between Max (Walter Matthau) and John (Jack Lemmon) has cooled and both of them patch things up, and their children, Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak), have become engaged. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to new wife Ariel (Ann-Margret). Max and John still call each other ""moron"" and ""putz"" respectively, but with friendly intentions.

The spring and summer fishing season is in full swing with the annual quest to catch ""Catfish Hunter,"" an unusually large catfish that seems to enjoy eluding anyone that tries to catch it. However, the local bait shop closed after Chuck, the previous owner died in the first movie, and Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) has purchased the property with the intent of converting it into a fancy Italian restaurant.

Irritated it will no longer be a bait shop, Max and John join forces to sabotage the restaurant. They are successful at first with their practical jokes. However, when Ariel learns what is going on, she tells John to apologize to Maria at once, and he does after Ariel kicks him out of the house. Max and Maria begin dating after discovering a shared passion for fishing, while her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) dates John's father, J.W. (Burgess Meredith).

To complicate things further, Jacob and Melanie call off their engagement due to stress from their parents' involvement. Upon hearing the news, John and Max reignite their feud. Ariel is stressed out because of it and leaves John until things settle down. At the restaurant, Francesca is worried about all the time Maria spends with Max. She reminds her daughter of her five failed marriages and worries that Max will make it six.

After being convinced to take a long look at herself, Maria reluctantly stops seeing Max. Distraught over losing Ariel, John heads to the lake for his father's advice but finds that he has died in his favorite spot with a fishing poll in one hand and a can of beer in the other. Following the funeral and the spreading of J.W.'s ashes in the lake, John and Max call off their feud again and John and Ariel reconcile.

After realizing that their own inability to properly plan a wedding is what drove their kids to call it off, they decide to set it right. They help Jacob and Melanie reconcile, and manage to catch ""Catfish Hunter"" but they reluctantly decide to release it so it can be with John's father in the lake, then clarify their own drama. After they let it go, they realize that they're late to a wedding happening in town and rush to the church as quickly as they can. The wedding is revealed to be for Max and Maria, who have reconciled. On the way to their honeymoon, they discover Max's one-eyed bulldog, Lucky, in the car with them, being put there by John earlier as a prank. Ragetti's is also reformed so it will be both a restaurant and a bait shop."
